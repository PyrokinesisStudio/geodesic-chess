This folder contains materials that need to be unified across the 
game. For example, the 'Pieces' material is used to identify what
game objects can be moved as pieces. This also helps keep consistency.

Note that the visual appearance for the boards are NOT defined using
the materials in this folder. The 'Tiles' material is used for the 
(normally transparant) objects that pieces can be placed on.
