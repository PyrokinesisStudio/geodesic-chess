# geodesic-chess
Geodesic Chess is a chess variant played on a sphere (ok geodesic sphere) as a 
board. Apparently the rules are similar to regular hexagonal chess, though I haven't
figured them out yet. I mean, what is diagonal when you aren't on a square board?

This game is made in Blender Game Engine, and is being developed in Blender 2.78a
